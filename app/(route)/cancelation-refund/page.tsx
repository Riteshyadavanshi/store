        SHOPHOLIC DIARIES believes in helping its customers as far as possible,
        and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li>
          Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 7
          days of placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not
          be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
          vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
          them.
        </li>
        <li>
          SHOPHOLIC DIARIES does not accept cancellation requests for
          perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
          refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
          quality of product delivered is not good.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the
          same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be
          entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at
          his own end. This should be reported within 7 days of receipt of the
          products.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the
          site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of
          our customer service within 7 days of receiving the product. The
          Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an
          appropriate decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty
          from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of any Refunds approved by the SHOPHOLIC DIARIES, it’ll take
          6-8 days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
        </li>
      </ul>
